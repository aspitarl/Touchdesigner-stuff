    * how to layer on top, not side by side
    * currently stacking left to right and changing align order to be able to see 16/9 video full screen. want to get the sidebars to go transparent instead. This will work the same on square videos and 16/9. 
    * can panels be a floating window? 

    * switch to active FX for panel parameters 
    * altertative: combine Fx panel tabs together. 

    add to front panel
    * switch folders automatically 
    * swtich to sequential playback

    how to scroll into the main patch? have to go to the edge right now


    Better way of mapping FX
        OSC -> channel display  -> python expression of parameter

        alternative: scaling in touch desiger and direct map

        ideally this can be flexible, and automatically change with song somehow...

        dropdown menu reflect OSC 

    
    make groups of osc messages
    button to clear osc messages.

group things into Bases and give glogal OP shortcut. create out top and give global shortcut to base ('me.name')

op.SHORTCUT_NAME.op('OUT')

* relative paths
    ../ = parent
    ../../ = parent(2)


* alt+n - null
